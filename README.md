A way to control your Display input selection using MQTT. This can be used to add to home automation tools or other automation for the switching of your monitor inputs. 

For my setup I have an old raspberrypi connected to a spare HDMI input on the monitor which listens for MQTT topics. Once recieved it will issue the command to switch the input to the required setting.
